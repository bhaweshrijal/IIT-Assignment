<h1>WEEK 7</h1><br>
<h1> MY FIRST WEB PAGE<h1>
<p>In the HTML unit, I want to learn how to structure web pages using semantic tags, create clean and accessible layouts, and understand the role of HTML in the broader web development process. Iâ€™m especially interested in mastering elements like headings, lists, tables, forms, and links, so I can build user-friendly interfaces that follow best practices. I also want to explore how HTML works alongside CSS and JavaScript, and how it supports responsive design and ethical digital experiences. My goal is to gain confidence in writing well-organized, standards-compliant code that serves real-world users.</p>
